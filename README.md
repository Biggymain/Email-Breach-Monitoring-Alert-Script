# 🔍 Email Breach Monitoring & Alert Script

This Python tool helps you **monitor if your email address appears in known data breaches** using the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API).
It runs daily, checks your email, and sends you **email and/or Telegram alerts** if your account has been exposed.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Automated breach checks with the Have I Been Pwned API
* 📧 Email alerts via Gmail SMTP
* 💬 Optional Telegram alerts for instant notifications
* ⏰ Daily scheduling at a set time (default: 09:00 AM)
